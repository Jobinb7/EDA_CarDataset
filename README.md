Project:Exploratory data analysis of a car dataset using python

Data : Dataset is taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shalwalsingha/cars-ds-final)
       This data set contains the automotive data.
       orginal data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ET_9EKbCO7702KIBSFDZur44nOiNQE1A/view?usp=sharing
       cleaned data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1819qAQzBKXPDDd5P8EnyIa8-nnX0b13N/view?usp=sharing

 🗂️ Project Structure
 The  folder inside this repository contains the python script ,various graphs and requirements.txt

 📈 Exploratory Steps
 1) Data loading and cleaning:The orginal csv file was cleaned and loaded into a local host MySQL database and created a  table and
                              the data is loaded into the python platform by making connection between the local host MySQL database .

 2) Find the missing values

 3)  Grouped the data based on categorical and bunerical variables

 4)  Univariate analysis
 5)  Multivariate nalysis
 6)  Normality tests
📊 Key Insights

The intial dataset contain 1262 rows and 129 columns.After determining the missing values in each columns by "df.isnull().sum()" and by plotting Missing values per columns.
